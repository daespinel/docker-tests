#Docker run is similar to do docker start and docker run

# docker command providing the route incoming requests to this port on local host to... the second port inside the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 <image name>

# Docker build with context and using tagging
docker build -t daespinel/xxxx .

# A container is a process running on dedicated resources (cpu, ram, disk)
# An Image is a file system snapshot with possible some starting command set up

# Attaching to a running container
docker exec -it <container-id> sh

# Docker connectivity (communicate among independent containers): The user can either use the Docker CLI networking features or Docker Compose

# Docker-compose automates some of the long-winded arguments we were passong to 'docker run' it also is used to start up multiple containers at the same time and connect them
# A docker-compose.yml will contain all the options we'd normally pass to docker cli (docker build and docker run)

# Docker run myimage
docker-compose up

# Docker build and docker run myimage
docker-compose up --build

# Launch a group of containers in the background
docker-compose up -d

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# docker compose restart policies: "no", always, on-failure, unless-stopped

# Docker ps
docker-compose ps
